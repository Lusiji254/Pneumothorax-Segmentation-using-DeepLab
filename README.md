# Pneumothorax-Segmentation-using-DeepLab
This is a machine learning model that detects and segments Pneumothorax from X-ray images. This has been executed through classification of the X-ray images which detects whether or not Pneumothorax is present then segmentation of the Pneumothorax when it is present. It is meant to assist doctors to automate the process of diagnosis of Pneumothorax and increase accuracy and consistency. 
Deeplab V3+ architecture was used to implement the segmentation model. The classification and segmentation models were then pipelined and a Streamlit interface was used to enable upload of X-ray images and display of diagnosis.
